obs_description          = Color visualization of the DESC DC2 simulation (red: band i, green: band r, blue: band g) with a hue-preserving stretch.  Processed by Rubin Observatory pipeline, release 22, for Data Preview 0.2, and rendered to HiPS at its native resolution of 0.2 arcsec.  Corresponds to up to five years of the projected LSST survey data.  See https://dp0-2.lsst.io/ for documentation.
