# The non-alpha tagged releases of lsst-daf-butler and lsst-resources are
# ancient since the project almost never makes releases, so we have to pin
# them to alpha versions.  This means the pip install command used by tox
# and the Makefile needs to include --pre.

# Recursive dependency of lsst-daf-butler, which also needs to be pinned
# to an alpha release or lsst-daf-butler will try to use the latest tagged
# release and fail due to missing modules.

# Uncomment this, change the branch, comment out safir above, and run make
